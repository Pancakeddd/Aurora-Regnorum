 flavor_tsb.4.d:0 "Apparently our fellow slavs in the north have been up to no good. A delegate from Kalut informs us that their people have been kidnapped by the Kadyak once again.

 flavor_tsb.11.a:0 "Well, they have been here longer."
 flavor_tsb.11.b:0 "We ought to be teaching them!"
 flavor_tsb.12.t:0 "Misunderstanding with Akhiok"
 flavor_tsb.12.d:0 "In our growing relationship with the Akhiok, somehow one of our people has greatly offended the people of Akhiok."

 flavor_vlz.1.t:0 "The Surrender of Saalinga"
 flavor_vlz.1.d:1 "While the Dena'ina object to our very presence in this land, Saalinga is one province that has been particularly controversial. In 1426, our settlers began illegally expanding up the Kenaa River, pushing the Kenaitze out. Our leaders promised to stop this homesteading, however we never got around to it. With the area all but ours, the Kenaitze have decided to demand the immediate return of Saalinga."
 flavor_vlz.1.a:1 "Despite our precious need of more land, we will honor our word."

In a display of bravery, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has gone to Kenaa himself to demand the Velreizans to keep their word. Of course, the Velreizans acted dishonorably, and we must accept that they do not intend to cooperate."
 flavor_vlz.2.a:0 "No more diplomacy, we end this now!"
 flavor_vlz.2.b:0 "While it is terrible, it is not worth so much bloodshed."
 flavor_vlz.3.t:0 "The Surrender of Saalinga"

 flavor_vlz.3.a:0 "Wonderful!"
 nantiinaq.1.t:0 "Sighting of the Nantiinaq"
 nantiinaq.1.d:0 "The people of Arrulaa'ik, a humble village on the far tip of Kenai, have sighted what seems to be the legendary Nantiinaq. Many believe that this hairy beast is responsible for many missing people in the region, so it may be in our best interest to send out a hunting party."
 nantiinaq.1.a:0 "By all means, gather a hunting party!"
 nantiinaq.1.b:0 "Perhaps it is best to let nature be, no matter how dangerous."
 nantiinaq.2.t:0 "Local of Arrulaa'ik vanishes"
 nantiinaq.2.d:0 "Another local has vanished in the black spruce foothills near Arrulaa'ik, a village increasingly being called cursed. Many blame the Nantiinaq, the hairy bipedal creature that haunts the nightmares of the townsfolk. If only we could put an end to this darkness."

 nantiinaq.3.t:0 "Search for Nantiinaq comes up empty"

The people of $COUNTRY$ will forever be known as the Killers of Nantiinaq!"
 nantiinaq.4.a:0 "Let us celebrate with a week-long feast!"
 nantiinaq.5.t:0 "Hunters find evidence"
 nantiinaq.5.d:0 "After months tracking the Nantiinaq, some evidence has been found. Our hunters have reported various remains of what could be Nantiinaq's kills. The evidence does, however, suggest that Nantiinaq lives much deeper inland than we thought. The question follows, should we invest more into a search further in the mountains?"
 nantiinaq.5.a:0 "We are so close! We must pursue this foul creature."
 nantiinaq.5.b:0 "It is too dangerous to go that far, let us continue searching closer to the village."
 nantiinaq.6.t:0 "Mysterious creature seen in Far Kenai"
 nantiinaq.6.d:0 "There is a strangeness in the backwoods of Kenai. Some have even reported to see a large shadowy figure in the distance. The locals tell us of some kind of entity they call the Nantiinaq, but this is likely all just superstition."

 flavor_afq.2.t:0 "To Save Afognak"
 flavor_afq.2.d:0 "With the fall of Fort Puyurniq, all hope seems lost of Afognak, and the Kodiak Archipelago as a whole. Seeing this, many Alutiiqs are pouring into Suyaraq in hopes of repelling the Kadyak menace. But are they too late?"

 flavor_afq.3.t:0 "Afognak pleads for help!"
 flavor_afq.3.d:0 "Fort Puyurniq, the strongest Alutiiq stronghold, has fallen to Kadyak. With the Europeans flooding onto the island, Afognak may have a few weeks until it capitulates. However, our Alutiiq brethren from the Qikertaq Archipelago are rallying on the island of Suyaraq in an all-or-nothing last stand. A messenger from Afognak has arrived in Nanwalek, pleading that we too would join in the fight."
 flavor_afq.3.a:0 "For the Alutiiq People!"

 flavor_kenai.1.d:0 "Long ago, there were giants in these lands. Among them were two lovers, Susitna and Nekatla, who feared the impending invasion of a fierce tribe from the North. Susitna, the giant beauty, stayed behind while Nekatla went to fight and die against the intruders. Susitna fell asleep while waiting for her lover, and the survivors saw that it was best to never wake her. In fact, they cast a spell that kept her in an eternal slumber, forever waiting for the fallen Nekatla. Wearing her blanket made of grass, Susitna became the mountain of Dghelishla, which still towers over the expanse of the Susitna Wilderness."

 kallaga.1.t:0 "Pirates of Kallaga"
 kallaga.1.d:0 "The Dena'ina of Kalgin have shown their utmost disloyalty in our biggest time of need! Despite their claim to follow our faith, Port Kalgin has fallen to traitorous pirates. With our war with the Kenaitze going so poorly, there is nothing we can do for the time being. If we can manage to subdue our enemies, those pirates will pay severely."

 flavor_aurora.1.t:0 "Spectacular Aurora"
 flavor_aurora.1.d:0 "While Auroras are not uncommon during the winter months, this month our land was graced with an truly magnificent one. Instead of the usual emerald green, we were graced with purples, reds, and pinks; dancing and rippling across the entire sky. It's all anyone can talk about."

 flavor_aurora.2.t:0 "Bear Attacks"
 flavor_aurora.2.d:0 "One of our communities has recently lost people and animals to a ferocious group of bears"

 flavor_aurora.2.b:0 "Dispatch a band of our soldiers to take it out."
 flavor_aurora.3.t:0 "Bears dealt with"
 flavor_aurora.3.d:0 "Our soldiers proved themselves very capable in tracking and killing the problematic bears. Our men have given the bear hides and meat to the families affected. However, they didn't process the biggest one, as they thought that our nation might want to taxidermy one to memoralize this moment."
 flavor_aurora.3.a:0 "That would be a waste of a good fur."
 flavor_aurora.3.b:0 "Of course, send it to the best taxidermist in our land."

 flavor_aurora.4.d:0 "Saint Augustine Island, known as Utakineq or Chu Nula, is a massive volcano sticking out of the sea. In [GetYear], the volcano erupted with a terrible fury.

 flavor_kdy.1.t:0 "Kodiak Otters Flood the Market"
 flavor_kdy.1.d:0 "It's no secret that otter pelts are highly sought after in Alaska. The trappers in Kodiak, however, seemed to be putting out otters in better quality and numbers than anyone else. This is causing the fur market to become more inflated as a result."
 flavor_kdy.1.a:0 "I want an otter hat please."
 flavor_kdy.2.t:0 "Kadyak suggests our subjugation."
 flavor_kdy.2.d:0 "With our Alutiiq brothers in Afognaq conquered, Kadyak looks to us. 'This does not need to end the same way it did for the Afognaq, we really can be quite reasonable' the messenger explains."
 flavor_kdy.2.a:0 "If it will bring peace."
 flavor_kdy.2.b:0 "Good luck crossing the straight, Gossak"
 flavor_aurora.5.t:0 "Birth of Ankuripaika"
 flavor_aurora.5.d:0 "The settlement known as New Tallin has been thriving for decades. However in recent years the prosperous town has exploded in size. The peninsula in between the Knik and Turnagain arms has been a natural magnet for trade, and the economy will only continue to expand."
 flavor_aurora.5.a:0 "Remarkable"
