 string_start_velreiz:0 "In the Spring of 1391, many of the European Refugees that had been living under the freshly founded §YKadyak§! Republic left in search of a land of their own. Among these were the §YVelreizans§!, a relatively large population of refugees of Latvian descent. Their name came from a saying that meaning “Once Again”. §YVelreiz§!, just like most of the other Latvian groups, ended up settling on the §YKenai Peninsula§!, specifically at the mouth of the Kenai River.\n\n§YVelreiz§! has been prosperous along the Kenai, prompting their rapid expansion further upriver. This has caused a significant amount of strife with the neighboring tribe of §YKenaitze§!. After some violent interactions, a fort was built in the settlement of Sodaat. In the year 1412, a regretful year for most §YVelreizans§!, §YKing Jazeps Kesgaila§! signed a contract promising that no §YVelreizan§! settler will continue up the river past Sodaat. In 1426, a few years after §YJazeps’s§! death, the settlers ignored the contract and settled the area of Saalingaa. The situation has grown unsettling as §YKenaitze§! has strengthened itself greatly, even bringing the weaker tribes of §YTitukilsk§! and §YNinilchik§! under its grasp. Perhaps a war is on the horizon.\n\nFurther up the Inlet, the nation of §YJoenkyla§! has begun to dominate the region. Back on the Kodiak Archipelago, the old overlord §YKadyak§! is challenging the strong tribe of §YAfognak§! for supremacy over the islands as well as the otter fur industry."
 string_start_kenaitze:0 "For centuries, §YKenaitze§! Has been a peaceful people in the land of §YYaghenen§!, the peninsula they call home. This all changed when the §YVelreizans§! and their sister settlements began showing up on seemingly every corner of the region. 34 years ago, §YKenaitze§! compromised with the §YVelreizans§!, signing the Treaty of the Kahtnu River, preventing the Europeans from settling into the Tak'elzheht area. Due to incompetence or malice, §YVelreiz§! has not kept that promise, leading to a heightened level of tension.\n\n§YKenaitze§! realized quickly that a united front of Dena’ina tribes was the only way to stand up to the European migrants. As a result, §YKenaitze§! has subjugated the neighboring tribes of §YTitukilsk§! and §YNinilchik§!. This has created the only native power bloc in the entire region, a force that even the people of §YVelreiz§! perceive as a serious threat."
 string_start_joenkyla:0 "The migrant Finns arrived in the Anchorage region in 1392 and quickly integrated the Dena'ina living there. The River Village, or §YJoenkylä§!, was in the best situation region to develop its surroundings. In 1433, following the Battle of Fireweed Lake, the §YJoenkyläns§! subjugated the neighboring §YMetsakylä§!. It seems that §YJoenkylä§! has an incredible amount of momentum, and it will be hard for the neighboring realms of §YVistarna§! and §YKarhava§! to not be absorbed into the Suomast Kingdom."
 string_start_kordovaa:0 "Ever since it's founding in 1403, §YThe Republic of Kordovaa§! has always enjoyed a degree of isolation. Even the culture of the nation, once identical to that of §YHeltermaa§! or §YVelreiz§!, has split off to be unapologetic and brash. A wealthy trader class in the nation has developed a desire to control wealth far beyond the coasts of the small nation."
 string_start_kadyak:0 "§YKadyak§! is the gateway to Alaska; the first place Europeans landed and settled following the great exodus from the Khanate in 1386. The Slavs have been the elite ruling class ever since, eventually forming the authoritarian §YKodukski§! dynasty. Following a further migration of most of the non-slavs further into Alaska in 1391, §YKadyak§! further cemented itself as a largely Russian-cultured kingdom.\n\n§YKadyak§! shares the Kodiak Archipelago with §YSvatosk§!, a far-less authoritarian Russian kingdom, and §YAfognak§!, its native rival since the very beginning.\nIn recent years, §YKadyak§! has gained the upper hand on §YAfognak§!, isolating them to their home island in the north. The stage is set for §YKadyak§! to win the entire archipelago, but §YAfognak§! may put up a stronger fight than expected."
 string_start_afognak:0 "The tribe of §YAfognak§! is on its last defense before ultimately succumbing to its rival, §YKadyak§!. The tribe has fought fiercely against its foe, but the rapidly organizing Russians have recently begun winning battles, even pushing the §YAfognak§! dominion to their namesake island. §YAfognak’s§! next moves must be careful and calculated, as marching across the strait will likely end in disaster.\n\nThe southern Alutiiq tribes of §YKalut§! and §YAkhiok§! may be of some use in the struggle. Perhaps even the distant §YNanwalek§! may lend a hand. The future of §YAfognak§! is anything but gray; either it is erased forever or it will be bright as the sun."
 string_start_svatosk:0 "The humble §YSvatosk§! was founded in 1392 when a group of people of Russian-descent moved south to §YThree Saints Bay§!. The migrants left §YKadyak§! in hopes of a more peaceful life, away from the constant threat of war with §YAfognak§! as well as the Authoritarian §YKoduksi§! regime. The people of §YSvatosk§! have hope of cooperation with the local tribes, and are much more open to having the Alutiiqs enter their country and even their government."
