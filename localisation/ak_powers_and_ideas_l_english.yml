Aabraham realized that he had no legitimacy to rule a kingdom, so he decided to forge a mythical story to make his future dynasty look destined for power. He wrote that he descended from a long lineage of viking warriors from Estonia and that his family only became peasants because of the German crusaders who forced them to settle down and convert to christianity. Over the decades this fabrication would be interpreted as fact and by the 1500s no one knew that the Jarvinen dynasty had an uneventful past."

Although the Alutiiq were distrustful of the Europeans, they soon grew to appreciate the kingdom’s acceptance of pagan religions and many joined the marines.

He would have tried to convert the whole country to paganism if it weren’t for the well respected clergy.

When Aabraham became king of Heltermaa, he promoted Longbeard to Head Admiral of the Heltermaan navy. As head of the navy, Longbeard would hunt the Prince William Sound for trade ships to plunder and fought many battles for the glory of Heltermaa.

Little did he know, this petty act of theft would lead to a bread epidemic throughout Alaska long after his death. Saaremaa Black Bread is a type of traditional rye bread unique to the island of Saaremaa that has a suprisingly rich and sweet taste. The recipe would follow the Laanemerians to their new home in Alaska and become a favorite dish for many. In Suklii, the poor soil was barely able to grow anything, but demand for bread remained high. The nobility, who were the only people who could afford to eat the bread most days, made myths about how the bread had magical properties and could increase the lifespan of the people who ate it. In the 1600s, advancements in the development of greenhouses and fertilizer led to cities such as Suklii finally having enough grain to start exporting abroad. Saaremaa Black Bread made in Suklii quickly became one of the most popular foods in Alaska due to its sweetness and nutritional value."

The fleet of Kipriye and Kenaitze clashed in the waters surrounding the port of Nikiski in the first naval engagement of the war. Despite being twice a large as the Kipriyak navy, the fleet of Kenaitze lost the battle and attempted to sail back to the harbour of Nikiski, However, Nikiski had surrendered to Kipriye before they even set foot in Kenai and declined the navy entry into the port. At this point the galleys of Kipriye had surrounded them and fired their cannons until every last enemy ship had sunk."

Soon after landing in Kustatan, the old boyars requested their power to be returned to them by the current king, Aleksander Brazhnikov. Aleksander agreed on the condition that the boyars build castles and outposts in their fiefs to defend against raiders. As the borders of Kipriye reached the Little Susitna River, King Ivan III Brazhnikov noticed that an enemy army from the east could easily traverse the shallow river and invade the kingdom. Inspired by Aleksander, he ordered the boyars to work together to make a long line of wooden defenses along the west side of the Little Susitna. As compensation, Ivan III granted them land in the new frontier settlements emerging further inland."

Kipriyak peasants were yearning for a break from oppressive boyars so they used the newly conquered land to make new settlements north of Kipriyak territory. The free peasants would live autonomously for years before king Ivan III would grant the boyars fiefs in newly settled villages. Even though the peasant villages were not newly settled, the boyars took the land anyway. The peasants held a successful strike that made Ivan III grant autonomy to newly founded towns even further north, incentivizing the expansion of the frontier while not taking away land from the boyars."
