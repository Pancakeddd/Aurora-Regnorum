Eventually, the Emishi were gradually assimilated into Japanese society through intermarriage, trade, and cultural exchange.\nIn recent times, some Japanese nobles in Tohoku have claimed descent from the Emishi, the ancient indigenous people of Japan. However, these claims have sparked controversy and unrest, with some opposing the idea of being governed by what they perceive as "barbarians."

As the influence of the Yamato state expanded, the Hayato people faced conflicts with the emerging central power. Wajin gradually conquered the Hayato territories, leading to their incorporation into the Japanese political and cultural sphere. Eventually, to solidify control over the region, the Yamato state initiated a policy of moving Hayato people to the Kinai area, the heartland of Yamato civilization in central Japan. \nIn recent times, certain Japanese nobles in the Kinai area have been making claims of descent from the ancient Hayato people, an ethnic group with Jomon ancestry. These assertions have triggered tensions among the broader Wajin population, who see the Hayato as "barbarians" and resist the prospect of being governed by those they perceive as culturally different.
