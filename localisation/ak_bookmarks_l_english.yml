The native Dena'ina people initially treated these strange people with benevolence, but now the tide is beginning to turn. The Kingdom of Velreiz has been promising to restrain its settlers for decades, and the native Kenaitze have long grown inpatient. Will one of these two enemies subdue the region, or will perhaps a smaller player rise up amidst the chaos to claim the rich land?"
